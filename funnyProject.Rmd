## Introduction

I found this equation on the internet and decided to plot it:

$$z = cos(x^2 +  y^2)$$

The result was not as funny as I thought it would be, but I already named the document and I don't want to change it.

This document was created in:
```{r}
Sys.Date()
```

## Graphic

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
source("R/funny.plot.R")
funny.plot()
```

Code for the plot is available in the github repository.
